## Unnamed's Not Named

**UNN** is a text editor with high ambitions and far-fetched goals.

It speaks with **Lisp**.

Depends on the awesome [notcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses) library and some **POSIX** headers.

Licensed entirely under the **GPL-3.0** license.

The project is currently not even in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage, WIP.
